/**
 * Dart's per-level stat table (TLoD-canonical, levels 1..60). Source:
 * `shareAI/assetsTLOD/characters/Dart/stats.txt`. Level 60 is the cap; the
 * helper clamps any higher input to that row.
 *
 * Currently exposed as REFERENCE DATA — DeathSystem awards XP and bumps the
 * level via the M9 progression curve, but doesn't yet rewrite Dart's Stats
 * from this table. Switching to TLoD-canonical numbers requires a parallel
 * rebalance of MOBS (the current AT 12 / DF 3 baseline is action-RPG-tuned,
 * not TLoD-tuned). When that pass happens, swap PLAYER_BASE.stats for a
 * lookup into `DART_STATS_BY_LEVEL[level]`.
 *
 * The Addition unlock column from the source table lives in
 * `DART_ADDITION_UNLOCKS_BY_LEVEL`. Unknown kinds (volcano / burningRush /
 * etc.) are stored as strings — they're not yet declared in ADDITIONS, so
 * any consumer must guard with `kind in ADDITIONS`.
